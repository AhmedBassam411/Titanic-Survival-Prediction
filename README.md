🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using KNN
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts survival on the Titanic using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The model is trained on the famous Titanic dataset, which includes demographic and passenger information.

📌 Project Overview
The Titanic survival prediction is a classic beginner-friendly machine learning task. This project uses KNN, a simple yet powerful classification algorithm, to classify whether a passenger survived based on features like age, sex, class, and fare.

🔍 Problem Statement
Given data about passengers on the Titanic, predict whether they survived (Survived = 1) or not (Survived = 0).

🧠 Model Used
Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Library: Scikit-learn (sklearn)

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score
